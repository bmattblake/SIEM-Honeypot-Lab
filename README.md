# SIEM Honeypot Lab

## TL;DR

In this lab, I created a honeypot virtual machine in the cloud and collected information about failed remote login attempts using a SIEM. Using Azure Sentinel, I plotted a heatmap of the attackers' locations on a world map to visualize where the attacks were coming from.

Below, I've documented a comprehensive outline detailing a four-stage process. The following step-by-step guide is designed to facilitate seamless progression from start to finish.

## Introduction

First, let's break down a couple of key terms

* **Honeypot:** A computer system that is intentionally made vulnerable to attract cyberattacks. It acts as a decoy,  and is used to gain information about cybercriminals and their attack vectors.
* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Software that collects computer logs and reports any unusual or suspicious activity.

Next, let's break down what we'll be doing :
